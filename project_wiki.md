# Business Understanding

## Detailed Description of the Business Problem
The project addresses the lack of personalization in bank marketing campaigns, which leads to low engagement and inefficient resource use. Traditional methods fail to leverage data effectively to meet individual customer needs.

## Key Stakeholders and Their Needs
- **Marketing Team**: Requires tools for creating effective, personalized campaigns.
- **Bank Executives**: Seek better marketing ROI and enhanced customer satisfaction.
- **IT Team**: Needs secure, reliable data systems.
- **Customers**: Prefer relevant marketing that meets their interests and needs.

## Success Criteria for the Project
- **Increased Engagement**: Higher engagement in personalized marketing campaigns.
- **Higher Conversion Rates**: More conversions from targeted campaigns.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Marketing strategies informed by model insights.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Cost-effective campaigns due to targeted personalization.

# Data Understanding

## Data Sources and Collection Methods
- **Customer Data**: Collected from bank databases, including demographic and transactional data.
- **Behavioral Data**: Includes app and website interactions.
- **External Data**: Economic indicators and relevant public data, if available.

## Initial Data Exploration Findings
- **Demographics**: Younger customers are more responsive to digital campaigns.
- **Transaction Patterns**: Specific transactions correlate with product preferences.
- **Engagement Trends**: Higher engagement correlates with higher conversion rates.

## Data Quality Assessment
- **Missing Data**: Some gaps in demographic and transaction data.
- **Data Consistency**: Formatting inconsistencies in engagement metrics.
- **Outliers**: Transaction and engagement outliers identified for review.

# Data Preparation

## Data Cleaning Processes
- Removal of duplicates, handling of missing values, and standardizing data formats.

## Feature Engineering Techniques
- Created features for customer lifetime value, frequency of transactions, and recent engagement metrics.

## SQL Queries Used for Data Transformation (with Explanations)
- Examples of queries used for aggregating transaction data, joining tables, and filtering by recent activity.

## Final Dataset Structure
A cleaned, structured dataset with essential features for model training and analysis.

# Modeling

## Modeling Techniques Considered
- Logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.

## Model Selection Criteria
- Chose models based on interpretability, accuracy, and computational efficiency.

## Detailed Description of the Chosen Model(s)
- **Gradient Boosting Model**: Selected for its accuracy in predicting conversion likelihood.

## Model Performance Metrics and Interpretation
- **Precision**: Indicates model’s ability to correctly identify true positives.
- **Recall**: Demonstrates how well the model identifies all positives.
- **F1 Score**: Balances precision and recall for a comprehensive metric.
